In this project there are two aspects that I believe 
are examples of going beyond the project requirement
these are: 

Using HTML canvas to generate a picture of a flag dynamicaly. 
This means that there are no pre created flag pictures 
and the ones that the user ends up seeing are all generated live 
using my generatePic() function. If a user were to switch around the 
order of the choices in the index.js file then there would be different 
flag combinations available to the user to create. 

The second part that I believe is worthy of note is the ability to 
take this automatically generated flag and convert it into a
dataURL and upload this image to the website imgur.com.
This is accomplished using my upload() method where I send a 
XMLHttpRequest to interface with imgurs image upload API. I then recieve the 
link if the upload was succesfull and display that on the page for the user to 
remotely link to if they want. This link is stored inside the localStorage 
and the next time they use the website the site will remember the link of 
the last image they had created. 


Sorry for uploading this project late.
